<p class="paragraph"> Stocks are a type of security that gives stockholders a share of ownership in a company. Companies sell shares typically to gain additional money to grow the company. This is called the initial public offering (IPO).after the (IPO), stockholders can resell shares on the stock market. Stocks represent an individual's stake in a company, like a pastry piece from a chocolate cake. This security is liquid. In other words, the trader can sell and encash them in short durations. examples include Amazon and Apple stocks.  </p>
<p class="paragraph"> Stocks are shares of ownership in publicly traded companies.Stock investments are very risky but profitable at the same time because you get your money depending on the profits made by the company you invested in. If the company is big and does well you are most likely to recieve more money but if the company is not doing well you do not get more money. In stock you get your money in the form of dividents everytime the company makes profits. Companies issue them on stock exchanges to raise money, at which point investors buy and sell them based on their potential to go up in value or pay dividents. Buying and holding stocks can help you grow your wealth and reach your long-term financial goals. A shareholder (or stockholder) is an individual or company (including a corporation) that legally owns one or more shares of stock in a joint stock company. Both private and public traded companies have shareholders. </p>
