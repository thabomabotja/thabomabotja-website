<p class="paragraph"> Investment banking pertains to certain activities of a financial services company or a corporate division that consist in advisory-based financial transactions on behalf of individuals, corporations, and governments. Traditionally asssociated with corporat finance, such a bank might assist in raising financial capital by underwriting or acting as the client's agent in the issuance of debt or equity securities.  </p>
<p class="paragraph"> All investment banking activity is classed as either "sell side" or "buy side". The sell side involves trading securities for cash or for the for other securities (e.g. facilitating transactions, marketmaking), or the promotion of securitires (e.g. underwriting, research, etc.). The "buy side" involves the provision of advice to institutions that buy investment services. Private equity funds, mutual funds, life insurance companies, unit trusts, and hedge funds are the most common types of buy-side entities. </p>
<p class="paragraph"> An investment bank can also be split into private and public functions with a screen separating the two to prevent information from crossing. The private areas of the bank deal with private insider information that may not be publicly disclosed, while the public areas such as stock analysis, deal with public information. An advisor who provides investment banking services in SA must be be a licenced broker-dealer </p>
