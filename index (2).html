<p class="para2">An investment is traditionally defined as the "commitment of resources to achieve later benefits". If an investment involves money, it can be defined as a "commitment of money to recieve more money later". In finance the purpose of investing is to generate a return on the invested asset. The return may consist of a profit or a loss realized from the sale of a property or an investment, unrealized capital appreciation (or deppreciation), investment income such as dividents, interest, or rental income, or a combination of capital gain and income. The return may also include currency gains or losses due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.  </p>

<p class="para3">  There are different types of investments individuals can look into before investing their money, such as investing in property, stock or even in banks to grow their money  </p>

<p class="para4">A good place to invest your money is in banks because it decreases the risks of an individual of not getting profits or even losing his/her money.  When you invest in banks your profits are determined by the countries perfomance and the growth in the currency, if it increases your profits also increases but if the currency decreases your profits will also decrease.  </p>

<p class="para5"> Investing is buying assets such as shares, unit trusts, or property with the expectation that your investment will make money for you. Investments usually achieve long-term goals. Investments can make your money work for you, and help you to create and preserve wealth.  </p>
