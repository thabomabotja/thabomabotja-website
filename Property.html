<p class="paragraph"> Real estate investing involves the purchase, management and sale or rental of real estate for profit. Someone who actively or passively invests in real estate is called a real estate enterpreneur or a real estate investor. Some investors actively develop, improve or renovate properties to make more money from them.</p>
<p class="paragraph"> Some individuals and companies focus their investment strategy on purchasing properties that are in some stage of foreclosure. A property is considered in pre-foreclosure when the homeowner has defaulted on their mortage loan. Formal foreclosure processes vary by state and may be judicial or non-judicial, which affects the length of time the property is in pre-foreclosure phase. Once the formal foreclosure processes are underway, these properties can be purchased at a public sale, usually called a foreclosure auction or a sheriff's sale. If the property is not sold at the public aution, then the ownership of the property is returned to the lender. Properties at this phase are called REOs. </p>

<p class="paragraph"> BRRR is a real estate investment strategy, used by real estate investors who have experience renovating or rehabbing properties to "flip" houses. BRRR is different from "flipping" houses. Flipping houses implies to buying a property and quickly selling it for a profit, with or without repairs. BRRR is a long-term investment strategy that involves renting out a property amd letting it appreciate in value before selling it. Renting a BRRR property provides a stable passive income source that is used to cover  mortage payments while home price appreciation increases future capital gains.
